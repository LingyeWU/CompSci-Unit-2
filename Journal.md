Comparing BASH to C

 || BASH | C
--- | --- | ---
Speed | Slower | Faster
First released | 1989 | 1972|
Functionality | Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. | C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.
Features | Bash supports brace expansion, command line completion, basic debugging | C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
