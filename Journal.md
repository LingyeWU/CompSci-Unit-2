Today we've started a new unit on binary-decimal conversion. We've discussed about how to create a two-button communication system and what are other alternatives for keyboard and mouses. We've also touched upon the idea of using Tinkercad and Arduino. The first several things we did was to explore the Arduino toolkit on our own and build a traffic light.

Comparing BASH to C

--- | BASH | C
--- | --- | ---
PROS | 1. Easy to learn and don't need ";" 2. already installed; 3. powerful with administrative tasks; 4. handy IT admin  | 1. Editing tools(IDE); 2. "Window"; 3. Users can develope their own electronic kit; 4. extremely powerful; simple syntax.
CONS | 1. syntax is unforgiving; 2. limited to terminal; 3. not a lot of resources on internet | 1. usage of additional programs to check your scripts; 2. too many unnecessary syntax

Today we've learnt more about Aruduino and tried to demonstrate decimal numbers in binary.

What is the meaning of void in a function?
1. Void as a Function Return Type
1. Void as a Function Parameter
1. Void as a Pointer Declaration

Variebles in C:

| Sr.No | Type&Description |
| --- | --- |
1 | _char_: Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type.
2 | _int_: The most natural size of integer for the machine.
3 | _float_: A single-precision floating point value.
4 | _double_: A double-precision floating point value.
5 | _void_: Represents the absence of type.
6 | _byte_: A byte stores an 8-bit unsigned number, from 0 to 255.
7 | _unsigned int_: unsigned ints (unsigned integers) are the same as ints in that they store a 2 byte value. Instead of storing negative numbers however they only store positive values, yielding a useful range of 0 to 65,535 ((2^16) - 1).
8 | _long_: Long variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes), from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
9 | _unsigned long_: Unsigned long variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes). Unlike standard longs unsigned longs wonâ€™t store negative numbers, making their range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).
10 | _string_: Text strings can be represented in two ways. you can use the String data type, which is part of the core as of version 0019, or you can make a string out of an array of type char and null-terminate it.

Today we've tried to use LED lights to show from 0 to 15. The problem I've personally faced was that I was not very familiar with the curcuit yet, leading to a series of mistakes during the construction.

Today we discussed our HMW duirng the weekend, shared and compared different approached, and at the same time, learnt about logic gates and tried to solve the problem with logic gates. It is very useful and effective! However I still have some questions regarding how to actually code it and also the different syntax in Arduino especially.

Nov.19th
=========
Today we have spent a whole class on doing the logic gate worksheet. I felt much more prepared with these logic gate notations. also investigated on the problem: does (!a+!b)=!a+!b?

Today Tuan and I collaborated to create a electronic number screen. The process was fairly complicated. We first encountered the problem on the circuit but quickly fixed it.

Nov.25th
==========
We started creating english input keyboard with 2 buttons:

1. Brainsotrm different ideas
1. Draw it out and put it into readme file under planing or development section
1. Start research
1. Start coding
I was really lost in today's class because I wasn't sure about what to do at all. It is easy to come up with an idea but I have no clue about how to put those ideas into code.

Nov.27th
==========
We built curcuits today. Dr. ruben intoduced us to the matrix array. We've got a homework and I managed to finish pretty fast.

Dec.2nd
========
Today we continued building our project.
We are supposed to do:
1. Find LCD circut in thinkercad and add 2 buttons
1. Build LCD circut with arduino kit
1. Draw a flow diagram for englsih keyboard program uploaded to classroom
1. Create letter to binary conversation table.

Dec.4th
========
Today we had the test. SOooooooooooOooOOOOOOOOOOO hard.
